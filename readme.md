<h3 align="center">Water Quality Predicition</h3>

## üßê About
A prediction model that predicts water quality in certain region given the satellite images and geographical data. In this case, the given data is from India.
The model is built with ensemble method of three models: Random Forests, Extra Trees, and CatBoost.

Tools used: Jupyter, Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, SciKit-Learn.

## üèÅ Achievement
Won second place in Pacific Conference on AI competition at UBC with total of 20+ team participants. Furthermore, our prediction model obtained the highest accuracy of all participants.

Note: this project is imported from kaggle, and thus no commit activity is shown here.
